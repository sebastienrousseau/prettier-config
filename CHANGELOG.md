## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.7] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- `engines.node` declaring the supported floor. The README and its badge advertised
  a floor that no manifest stated; CI now proves it across Node 20, 22, 24 on
  Linux, macOS and Windows.
- Shared conformance suite via `@sebastienrousseau/config-kit`, replacing the
  per-repository boilerplate. It checks packaging, declared types against runtime
  shapes, dependency resolvability, tarball contents, licence headers, version
  coherence and documentation links.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `docs/packaging.md` and
  `docs/adr/` architecture decision records.
- `sideEffects: false`, so bundlers can drop the package when it is unused.

### Changed

- `index.mjs` now re-exports `index.cjs` instead of duplicating it, which makes the
  two entrypoints identical by construction.
- CI, publish, security and docs workflows are thin callers of reusable workflows in
  `sebastienrousseau/config`, so a gate added once applies to the whole family.
- The release pipeline no longer marks the npm publish step `continue-on-error`; a
  failed publish now fails the job instead of reporting green.

### Fixed

- `index.d.ts` is asserted against the runtime export shape in CI.
- Corrected the OpenSSF Best Practices badge, which pointed at another project.

### Changed

## [0.0.3] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Architecture documentation in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Dual licensing under Apache-2.0 OR MIT terms.
